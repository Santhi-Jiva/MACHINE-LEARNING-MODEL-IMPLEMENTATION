# ðŸ¤– NLP-Based Chatbot

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves building a simple rule-based or NLP-powered chatbot using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** libraries like **NLTK** or **spaCy** in Python. The chatbot can answer predefined user queries, simulate conversation, and demonstrate the core functionality of text processing, intent matching, and response generation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization (using NLTK/spaCy)
- Intent classification using simple keyword matching or ML model
- Rule-based response generation
- Easy to extend for more complex use cases (e.g., FAQ bot, customer support)
- Console-based interaction

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) or [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)
- `json` or `yaml` for storing intents
- `re` (regex) for basic NLP tasks
- (Optional) `scikit-learn` for ML-based classification
